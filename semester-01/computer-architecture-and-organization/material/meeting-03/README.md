# Meeting 03 - Number System Conversion and Data Representation

This session explores how computers represent and convert different number systems, as well as how they store and interpret data internally.

## Covered Topics
- Introduction to Number Systems:
  - Binary (base-2)
  - Octal (base-8)
  - Decimal (base-10)
  - Hexadecimal (base-16)
- Conversion Between Number Systems:
  - Decimal to Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal
  - Binary to Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal
  - Octal to Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal
  - Hexadecimal to Binary, Decimal, Octal
- Data Representation Concepts:
  - Numeric data: integer, float, fixed-point
  - Character data: ASCII and Unicode
  - Multimedia data: image, audio, video formats
  - Boolean data: true/false logic
- Examples:
  - Conversions using repeated division
  - Bit grouping methods for binary â†” octal/hex
  - Real-world examples (IP Address, Port representation)
