# Meeting 02 - Von Neumann & Harvard Architecture, Data Path & Control

This session discusses the internal structure of a computer system by comparing the **Von Neumann** and **Harvard** architectures, followed by an introduction to **data path** and **control unit** operations.

## Covered Topics
- Differences between **Von Neumann** and **Harvard** architecture:
  - Shared vs. separate memory for instructions and data
  - Advantages of parallel access in Harvard
- Components in the **Data Path**:
  - ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
  - Registers: PC, MAR, MBR, IR, Accumulator
  - Memory bus and control signals
- **Control Unit**:
  - Role in instruction fetch, decode, execute
  - Micro-operations and signal generation
- **Instruction Cycle**:
  - Understanding the step-by-step CPU workflow
- **LMC Simulation**:
  - Practicing with Little Man Computer
  - Basic opcodes: INP, OUT, STA, LDA, ADD, SUB, HLT
